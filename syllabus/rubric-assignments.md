## Rubric for Evaluating Assignments


Each assignment will be graded out of four points: 

- __completeness__: one point for making a good-faith effort at every part of the assignment.
- __correctness__: one point for technically-correct, working solutions to each part.
- __coding__: one point for clean, well-formatted, easily readable code.
- __description__: one point for clear descriptions, interpretations, explanations.

      	well documented, commented</td>

      	contains extraneous/unnecessary computations</td>
      <td>Code contains bugs, irrelevant,
      	or missing key component</td>

    <tr>
      <td><b>Description</b></td>
      <td>Explanation is correct, convincing,
      	conclusions explicitly connected to
      	analysis and context</td>

      	correct but incomplete</td>
      <td>Explanation is illogical, incorrect
      	or incoherent</td>
